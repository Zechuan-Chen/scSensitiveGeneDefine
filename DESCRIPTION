Description:A toolkit to define the sensitive genes in scRNA-seq, and remove the impact of sensitive genes, which will improve the accuracy of Unsupervised clustering. "scSensitiveGeneDefine" aims to enable users to identify the sensitive genes in Single cell transcript. This method apply to the samples with cell types distinguished not well.
